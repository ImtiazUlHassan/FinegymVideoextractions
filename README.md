# FinegymVideoextractions
This repository contains scripts for extracting videos from both the FineGym99 and FineGym288 datasets. It includes functionality for building CSV files with relevant data and using MoviePy to trim the videos to capture exact events. The scripts are designed to streamline the process of preparing videos from both datasets for analysis
