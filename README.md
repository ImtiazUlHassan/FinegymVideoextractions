# FineGym Video Extractions

This repository provides scripts for extracting videos from the FineGym99 and FineGym288 datasets. It includes functionality for building CSV files with relevant metadata and utilizes MoviePy to trim the videos to capture precise events. The scripts are designed to simplify the process of preparing video data for analysis from both datasets.
